Create four Crystal buttons
Generate a Random Number (between 19 - 120) and display to the player.

Assign a random no to each Crystal (number should be between 1 - 12).
game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

Update user score by adding the crystal related no when the crystal button is clicked.
update the player's score counter.

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. 
Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. (do not refresh the page to restart the game)
